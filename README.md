# Classic Arcade Game
Classic Arcade Game is a browser-based game where you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies.

## How the Game Works

- The player can move left, right, up, and down.
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.
- Once the player collides with an enemy, the lose counter will increase, and the player moves back to the starting square.
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the win counter will increase, and after every three wins, the level will increase, which will make the game harder.
